# SymbolicMath
Contains a lexer/parser for creating a parse tree of an arithmetic expression. These parse tree could be used to evaluate symbolic expressions or perform algebraic operations (e.g. differentiation) on symbolic expressions.

See the `Parse_Arithmetic_Expressions.pdf` for the LL(1) grammar on which the parser is based.
